This is work I completed as part of my Master's Program.

This was an exploration of whether Alice in Wonderland more closely resembled a story of a child's dream experience or of one slipping into delusion. To this end I retrieved Delusion and Dream: An Interpretation in the Light of Psychoanalysis of Gradiva by Sigmund Freud – a description of adults experiencing delusion - and The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The question I first attempted to answer was whether Lewis Carroll’s text shares words or phrases in common with a story purely exploring a child’s imaginative adventure. 
After finding that Alice in Wonderland shared more in common with The Little Prince, I performed a comparison.
